# Research 
## [Rural Roads and Adaptation to Climate Shocks (October 2025)](https://github.com/ktpeters/Rural-Roads-)
Finding and cleaning historical Indian census data, using geopandas to map to current road networks, and developing a regression discontinuity study of rural roads’ impact on adaptation to climate variation.
## [SOC Change in Farmer fields (Thesis, May 2025)](https://github.com/ktpeters/SOC-Change-in-Farmer-Fields-22-23)
Honors thesis project on Indian smallholder farmer incentives to enter global Voluntary Carbon Credit markets. The result of my research was a cost benefit analysis, utilizing farmer’s field surveys, regional information about farmer profits and price fluctuations, as well as current credit market estimations of the Social Cost of Carbon. From the ground truth panel data set, I used an econometric difference in differences model in Python in order to project average yearly Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and rice yield changes per field.
## [Calculating Vegetation Indices from Sentinel-2 Data (June 2024)](https://github.com/ktpeters/Calculating-Vegetation-Indices-from-Planet-API)
Created a pipeline to process open access Sentinel-2 imagery at 10-meter resolution, extracting multiple vegetation indices from its 13 spectral bands per pixel, 
aggregating this data at the field level, and refining the dataset to eliminate anomalies and smooth time series fluctuations. The code for evaluating Vegetation 
Indices in Landsat 7 and 8 is shown in both Python and in Javascript.

### [Satellite Prediction of SOC for farmers in Odisha, India (AGU conference December 2024)](https://github.com/ktpeters/Calculating-Vegetation-Indices-from-Planet-API/blob/main/AGU%20poster.pdf)
By integrating this with precise ground truth data from Odisha, India, and employing the machine learning techniques of Random Forest, Long Short Term Memory Models, 
and Convolutional Neural Networks, we aim to predict rice yield and SOC accurately. For the purpose of model training, this project utilizes a pre-intervention baseline soil 
analysis from mid 2022 for the ground-truth SOC data and survey from 2019 to 2022 for the ground-truth yield data. This data is presented on two levels: surface and subsurface levels.
