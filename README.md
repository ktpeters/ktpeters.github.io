##Calculating Vegetation Indices from Sentinel-2 Data (June 2024)
- Created a pipeline to process open access Sentinel-2 imagery at 10-meter resolution, extracting multiple vegetation indices from its 13 spectral bands per pixel, aggregating this data at the field level, and refining the dataset to eliminate anomalies and smooth time series fluctuations. By integrating this with precise ground truth data from Odisha, India, and employing the machine learning techniques of Random Forest, Long Short Term Memory Models, and Convolutional Neural Networks, we aim to predict rice yield and SOC accurately. For the purpose of model training, this project utilizes a pre-intervention baseline soil analysis from mid 2022 for the ground-truth SOC data and survey from 2019 to 2022 for the ground-truth yield data. This data is presented on two levels: surface and subsurface levels.
The code for evaluating Vegetation Indices in Landsat 7 and 8 is shown in both Python and in Javascript.
